StreamingService
================

A response type for SOAP web services using MTOM to stream large amounts of records encoded as protocol buffers. The client processes records while the server is still sending. There is no need to keep the whole result set in main memory neither on the server nor on the client as the response type consumes buffers from an iterator and writes them to a stream while the client consumes records from an iterator that is fed from the stream. The response type is agnostic about the type of protocol buffers transferred, it just must be known on both the client and the server side.

The tests contain an example web service that transfers a million small protocol buffers in a few seconds with the client and server running on the same machine.

In the web service interface you must define the result type of the web method to be a StreamingResponse of the desired record type:

    @WebMethod(operationName = "snafucate")
    public StreamingResponse<Record> snafucate(int i) throws IOException;

In the web service implementation you must enable MTOM and streaming attachments:

    @WebService(endpointInterface = "org.avidj.snafu.sss.SnafucationWS")
    @MTOM // enable the MTOM feature for parsing buffers at the client while server is sending
    @StreamingAttachment(parseEagerly = false, dir = "/tmp", memoryThreshold = 1000000L)
    @Service

On the client you must also enable MTOM and streaming attachments:

    private SnafucationWS connect() {
        Service result = null;
        try {
            result = Service.create(
                    new URL(serviceUrl + "?wsdl"), 
                    new QName("http://sss.snafu.avidj.org/", "SnafucationWSImplService"));
        } catch (MalformedURLException e) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Could not create web service endpoint.", e);
        }
        SnafucationWS port = result.getPort(SnafucationWS.class,
                // Enable MTOM at the client for transmitting binary data
                new MTOMFeature(),
                // Load off attachments to the file system when too large
                new StreamingAttachmentFeature("/tmp", false, 1000000L));
        return port;
    }
